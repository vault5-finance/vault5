## Quick Start

Prereqs:
- Node 18+ (or newer LTS)
- MongoDB 5+ (local or hosted)
- Optional: SMTP creds for production email; SMS provider for production OTP

Backend:
- cp .env.example .env
- Configure MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET (at minimum)
- npm install
- npm run dev (run only one instance to avoid port conflicts)

Frontend:
- npm install
- npm start

Production builds:
- Frontend: npm run build
- Backend runs behind a process manager or container

Dev Notes:
- Ensure only one backend dev server is running (npm run dev) to avoid EADDRINUSE errors
- Kill duplicate processes with taskkill /PID <pid> /F on Windows

## Environment Flags (Dev)

- OTP_ACCEPT_ANY=true allows any OTP to succeed in development
- FRONTEND_URL sets the frontend base for verification redirects

Security:
- Never enable OTP_ACCEPT_ANY in production
- Always use HTTPS and secure JWT secrets

## Phone Number Normalization

UX-friendly input where +254 is prefilled:
- If user types 010xxxxxxx after +254 (forming +2540...), the system normalizes to +25410xxxxxxx
- Comparison and validation are format-agnostic across +254, 254, 0, and local 7/1 leading numbers

Reference:
- [normalizePhoneNumber()](backend/utils/phoneUtils.js:11)
- [arePhoneNumbersEqual()](backend/utils/phoneUtils.js:109)

## Email & OTP Verification

- Email links redirect to frontend status page after backend verification
- OTP for phone numbers can be tested in dev with OTP_ACCEPT_ANY=true
