UI: Founder Card Component
- Add a founder card to public-facing pages (Landing or About).

2) Use a high-quality portrait at: frontend/public/assets/founder-avatar.jpg
3) Add the following Google Fonts in frontend/public/index.html:
   <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@600;700&family=Inter:wght@300;400;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
4) Extend Tailwind fonts in tailwind.config.js:
   theme: { extend: { fontFamily: { sans: ['Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'], display: ['Poppins', 'Inter'] } } }
5) Import and render in the desired page:
   - import FounderCard from '../components/FounderCard';
   - <FounderCard />

Example usage references:
- Nav/header integration: [NavBar.js](../frontend/src/components/NavBar.js)
- Pages for placement:
  - Landing page: frontend/src/pages/Landing.js (add section near the footer)
  - About page: frontend/src/pages/AboutUs.js (add as a hero component)

Docs Integration:

## Founder Story ‚Äî ‚ÄúFrom Discipline to Freedom‚Äù

January 2025. I was staring at a spreadsheet at 1:17 AM, the kind of silence where even Nairobi traffic feels like a distant memory. My money wasn‚Äôt misbehaving; my habits were. I wanted a simple system that would not negotiate with my impulses ‚Äî one that would tell my money where to go before feelings woke up. I sketched six vaults on paper: Daily, Emergency, Investment, Long-Term, Fun, Charity. It looked too simple to fail.

The eureka moment didn‚Äôt arrive as fireworks; it arrived as friction. The more I tried to manually stick to discipline, the more I realized: discipline is rarely sweet ‚Äî it‚Äôs the heat that separates ore from gold. You don‚Äôt ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù smelting; you endure it to wear the gold. That night the vision shifted from a personal tool to a public mission: if this thing can harden my behaviors, it can serve families, businesses, and communities across Africa. I would be selfish to hoard the crucible for myself.

Vault5 became the name ‚Äî a vault not just for money, but for habits, goals, and community wealth. A system that splits, enforces, and reminds ‚Äî so you can suffer less from guesswork and enjoy more of the outcome. From that night forward, the burden became clear: turn discipline into a product, so freedom becomes predictable.

Change Log (Founder-specific, 2025):
- 2025-01: Inception and first vault allocation sketch
- 2025-09: Established founder credit policy and UI component guidelines
- 2025-09: Added FOUNDER.md, README links, and public docs conventions
