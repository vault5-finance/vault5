Display Guidelines (Docs & App):
- Always attribute the origin of the project to the founder: ‚ÄúVault5 was founded by Bryson Nyaliti.‚Äù
- Do not add other names as co-founders or credits unless explicitly approved by the founder.
- Public docs and UI must not imply copying or cloning of other products. Comparative references are allowed (see LEGAL-NOTES.md) but Vault5 is original work.

UI: Founder Card Component
- Add a founder card to public-facing pages (Landing or About).
- Recommended placement: near the footer on the Landing page or prominently at the top of the About page.
- Uses TailwindCSS. Ensure fonts load early to avoid layout shifts.

Implementation instructions:
1) Create the component at: frontend/src/components/FounderCard.jsx
2) Use a high-quality portrait at: frontend/public/assets/founder-avatar.jpg
3) Add the following Google Fonts in frontend/public/index.html:
   <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@600;700&family=Inter:wght@300;400;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
4) Extend Tailwind fonts in tailwind.config.js:
   theme: { extend: { fontFamily: { sans: ['Inter', 'system-ui', 'sans-serif'], display: ['Poppins', 'Inter'] } } }
5) Import and render in the desired page:
   - import FounderCard from '../components/FounderCard';
   - <FounderCard />

Example usage references:
- Nav/header integration: [NavBar.js](../frontend/src/components/NavBar.js)
- Pages for placement:
  - Landing page: frontend/src/pages/Landing.js (add section near the footer)
  - About page: frontend/src/pages/AboutUs.js (add as a hero component)
- React route registry: [App.js](../frontend/src/App.js)

Suggested founder card content:
- Name, role, mission statement
- Buttons: ‚ÄúView GitHub‚Äù, ‚ÄúContact‚Äù
- Footer: ¬© 2025 Vault5

Sample text (can be adapted):
- ‚ÄúBuilding Vault5 to democratize disciplined, rules-driven finance for communities ‚Äî born in Nairobi, built for the continent and the world.‚Äù

Docs Integration:
- Link this document from the main README: [FOUNDER.md](./FOUNDER.md)
- Add a short blurb in CREDITS.md referencing the founder as sole originator unless otherwise approved.

Branding & Legal Notes:
- Vault5 is not a clone; it is original work by the founder. Comparative references to PayPal and others are allowed for UX analogies only. See [LEGAL-NOTES.md](./LEGAL-NOTES.md).
