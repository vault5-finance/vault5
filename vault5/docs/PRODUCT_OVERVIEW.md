# Vault5 in Plain Language — How It Works and Why It Exists (2025)

What is Vault5?
- Vault5 is your personal bank + financial coach.
- It helps you build financial freedom through discipline.
- It guides how your money is split, saved, invested, enjoyed, and shared.

Who is it for?
- Anyone who wants to manage money better: earners, students, small business owners, and families.
- People who want a simple plan that they can stick to consistently.

The Big Idea (Simple)
- Every time you get money (salary, business, side gigs), Vault5 helps you split it into “vaults” with a purpose.
- You see your goals, your progress, and whether you’re on track.
- You get gentle nudges and smart rules that help you stay disciplined.

The Six Default Vaults (fully customizable)
- Daily: everyday spending (food, transport, airtime, small bills).
- Emergency: safety net for unexpected life events.
- Investment/Wealth: long-term growth (T-Bills, funds, stocks, rentals, etc.).
- Long-Term Goals: big goals like car, land, education, home, business assets.
- Fun/Freedom: guilt-free enjoyment (experiences, treats).
- Charity: giving and social support (your values).

When Income Comes In
- You record the income (or it’s linked through integrated accounts in the future).
- Vault5 auto-splits it into your vaults using your chosen percentages.
- You see:
  - Target: what you should have put in each vault.
  - Shortfall (red): what you missed (a “discipline debt” to fix later).
  - On Target (green).
  - Surplus (blue): when you do better than the plan.

Discipline, Made Easy
- Goals per vault with progress bars.
- Friendly notifications when you’re behind or ahead.
- “Debt ledger” for missed deposits so you can catch up later without guesswork.
- Surplus celebrations to build momentum.

Lending to Family and Friends (rules that keep you safe)
- Life happens. People ask for help.
- Vault5 suggests a safe source mix (for example: mostly from Fun and Charity, some from Daily) so you don’t hurt your Emergency or Long-Term vaults.
- If the request is too big, Vault5 suggests a safe maximum.
- You can mark lending as repayable or a gift and track it over time.
- You can set limits on how many non-repayable lending events per month/quarter.

Your Money Health Dashboard
- A quick view of net worth, goal progress, and discipline score.
- Trend reports weekly, monthly, yearly.
- Exports to PDF or Excel when needed.

Investments and Loans
- Track your investments: what they are, how they grow, and when they mature.
- Track loans: principal, payments, schedule, remaining balance.
- Keep a clear separation between investment growth and day-to-day spending.

Connected Accounts (now and future)
- You can record cash and bank transactions.
- Future phases: deep integrations with mobile money and banks.
- Everything still respects your plan and discipline rules.

Privacy and Safety
- Your data is private.
- We prioritize clear consent and simple language.
- You choose what to connect and what to keep manual.
