Scope
- Applies to all Vault5 customers in Kenya.
- Covers complaints about accounts, transactions, fees, lending features, service availability, privacy/security concerns, and conduct of Vault5 staff or systems.
- Where a licensed payment/financial partner is involved, their rules and resolution timelines will also apply.

A) Definitions
