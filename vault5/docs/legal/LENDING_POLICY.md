# Vault5 Lending & Borrowing Policy — Kenya (2025)

Status
- Created for Kenya launch readiness. Align with Kenyan law and regulator expectations. Requires review by Kenyan counsel before public release.
- Applies to social/family lending features and any future formal lending products offered via partners.

Purpose
- Define how Vault5 manages lending and borrowing features in a way that protects users, complies with law, and supports financial discipline.
- Clarify rules for safe lending sources, limits, disclosures, tracking, and collections conduct.

Scope
- Social/Family Lending: User-initiated records of money lent to friends/family with optional repayment expectations (“non-institutional lending”).
- Admin/Partner-Led Lending: Any formal credit products must be provided via licensed entities and are subject to separate, product-specific terms and regulatory approvals.

A) Principles (Kenya Context)
- Lawful & Transparent: Follow Kenyan laws, consumer protection norms, and partner program rules.
- Safety First: Encourage safe lending behavior with clear source rules to avoid harming essential vaults (Emergency, Long-Term).
- Consent & Records: Provide plain-language explanations of amounts, timing, and expectations (repayable vs. gift).
- No Predatory Conduct: Prohibit harassment, intimidation, or illegal collections practices.

B) Social Lending Feature (User-to-User Context)
- Recording a Lending Event
  - User may classify an event as repayable or a gift.
  - Disclosures include total amount, date, borrower identity (name/phone/email), and agreed timeline (if any).
- Safe Source Mix (Recommended Defaults)
  - By default, funds should be allocated from non-essential vaults in the following order:
    1) Fun/Freedom vault (primary)
    2) Charity vault
    3) Daily vault (as a smaller portion where necessary)
  - Emergency and Long-Term vaults should not be used unless the user opts-in with a double confirmation and notes specific reasons (emergency medical, existential risk).
- Caps & Frequency
  - Users can set monthly/quarterly caps for non-repayable lending (gifts).
  - If requests exceed safe capacity, Vault5 suggests a lower safe amount or defers to future cycles.
- Tracking and Ledgers
  - Repayable loans tracked in a ledger with optional reminders.
  - Gifts tracked separately to avoid mischaracterizing repayment expectations.
- Collections Conduct
  - Vault5 prohibits abusive, harassing, or illegal behavior. The platform only provides reminders or records; users must comply with Kenyan law and good conduct.

C) Formal Lending Products (Partner-Provided)
- Any credit facility (e.g., personal loans, MSME credit) will be provided via licensed financial institutions or digital credit providers recognized by Kenyan regulators.
- Partner Terms
  - All interest rates, fees, schedules, and penalties shall be disclosed clearly before acceptance.
  - Risk assessments and approvals follow partner policies and regulatory standards.
  - Vault5 does not approve/decline independent credit unless licensed to do so; it facilitates the UX and disclosures.
- Data Sharing and Consent
  - Any data sharing with partner lenders (KYC details, risk signals) must be consent-based and lawful per the Kenya Data Protection Act (2019).
  - Users can view what data is shared and revoke future sharing where legally permitted (note: revocation may affect services).

D) Disclosures and User Experience
- Clear Summaries
  - For each lending action, show amount, source mix, any applicable fees (for partner products), due dates, and consequences.
- Cooling-Off and Confirmations
  - For risky lending (using Emergency or Long-Term vaults), require double-confirmation and a cooling-off hint (e.g., “Consider waiting 24 hours unless urgent”).
- Alerts and Nudges
  - Shortfall/debt ledger increases for missed deposits and lending should trigger gentle nudges to rebalance later.

E) Limits, Holds, and Reserve Behavior
- For social lending, the platform enforces user-set limits, not third-party regulated holds.
- For partner-led loans or disbursements, partner reserve/hold policies apply (e.g., settlement delays, reserve periods for risk).
- Compliance Flags (temporary_30/180)
  - If an account is under limitation, lending and certain disbursements may be restricted until clearance.

F) Collections and Disputes (Social Lending)
- Vault5 provides tracking, reminders, and status labels (due, overdue, written-off).
- Prohibited Conduct
  - No abusive messages, threats, or unlawful collection tactics via Vault5 or otherwise.
  - Repeated violations may lead to limitations or account actions under the Acceptable Use Policy.
- Dispute Handling
  - Encourage amicable resolution; Vault5 does not adjudicate private disputes.
  - Provide clear export of records if parties seek third-party mediation or legal recourse.

G) Fees and Pricing
- Social lending ledger features are generally included as part of the user’s plan; any fee-based add-ons will be disclosed plainly.
- For partner-led lending products, fees/interest are governed by partner T&Cs, disclosed before acceptance.

H) Data Protection and Privacy (Kenya DP Act)
- Use and share only the data necessary for the feature or partner product.
- Provide clear consent prompts and respect data subject rights (access, correction, deletion subject to lawful retention).
- Maintain records and audit trails per legal and partner obligations.

I) Risk, AML/CTF, and Reporting
- Vault5 will monitor transactions and lending patterns for suspicious activity in line with AML/CTF policies (POCAMLA/FRC guidance).
- Where required, we may file STRs with FRC; users will not be “tipped off” if law prohibits notice.

J) Changes and Versioning
- Updates to this policy will be published in the Legal Center and versioned.
- Material changes will be notified to users and may require re-acceptance.

Kenya-Specific References (Practical)
- Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) and National Payment System (NPS) Regulations for licensed operations via partners.
- Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act (POCAMLA) and FRC guidance for suspicious activity.
