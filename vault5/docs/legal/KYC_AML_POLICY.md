# Vault5 KYC and AML Policy (Template, 2025)

Status
- Template for review by licensed counsel and compliance advisors before public use.
- Initial focus: Kenya; future regions will require specific annexes.

Purpose
- Define how Vault5 identifies users (KYC) and prevents money laundering and terrorism financing (AML/CFT).
- Balance safety, user dignity, and regulatory obligations.

Plain Summary
- We verify identity when required by law or risk.
- We monitor for suspicious activity and report where required.
- We keep only the data we need and protect it carefully.

1) Scope
- Applies to Vault5 products and any financial integrations.
- Applies to employees, contractors, and systems that process identity or transaction data.

2) Governance and Roles
- Founder acts as accountable executive for compliance until a dedicated Compliance Officer is appointed.
- Compliance Officer (when appointed):
  - Maintains program and training,
  - Oversees KYC reviews, enhanced due diligence,
  - Coordinates suspicious activity reports (SARs/STRs) where applicable,
  - Liaises with regulators and law enforcement.

3) Customer Due Diligence (CDD)
- Basic KYC (for applicable features): full name, date of birth, phone, email, government ID (type and number), and proof of address if required.
- Verification methods may include:
  - Document capture and validation (ID card/passport),
  - Face match (selfie liveness) via approved vendors (where lawful),
  - Database checks (sanctions, PEP, watchlists).
- Low-risk accounts may be allowed partial functionality pending verification (limits apply).

4) Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)
- Applied when risk indicators are present (e.g., high volumes, complex patterns, matches to PEP/sanctions).
- Additional information may include source of funds, additional documentation, and manual review.
- Limits and account restrictions remain until EDD concluded.

5) Risk Assessment and Scoring
- Risk factors:
  - Geography (country risk),
  - User profile (PEP, sanctions),
  - Transaction patterns (amounts, frequency, counterparties),
  - Product risk (e.g., lending or cross-border features).
- Controls scale with risk: lower limits, slower payout, manual approval.

6) Ongoing Monitoring
- Automated checks for unusual activity (velocity, caps, day/time patterns).
- Triggers:
  - Rapid balance movement without clear purpose,
  - Structuring to avoid thresholds,
  - Repeated external transfers to risky endpoints,
  - Sanctions list updates.
- Alerts reviewed by compliance; actions include clarification requests, temporary limitations, or SAR/STR (if required by law).

7) Sanctions, PEP, and Watchlists
- Screen users (and when applicable, counterparties) against known lists (e.g., UN, OFAC, local).
- Positive/possible matches result in review, limitation, or denial as required.

8) Records and Retention
- Keep KYC records securely for the period required by law (country-specific, e.g., 5–7 years).
- Keep audit logs of checks, decisions, and communications.
- See Data Retention Policy → [DATA_RETENTION_POLICY.md](./DATA_RETENTION_POLICY.md)

9) Privacy and Data Protection
- Collect only what is necessary.
- Protect KYC data with highest safeguards and limited access.
- Provide access and correction rights as allowed by law.
- Follow regional data protection laws (e.g., Kenya Data Protection Act, GDPR).

10) Reporting Obligations
- File SAR/STR where required by local law and within required timelines.
- Do not tip off users about investigations, to the extent the law prohibits doing so.
- Maintain secure channels for regulator communication.

11) Training and Awareness
- Staff handling KYC/AML receive regular training on:
  - Pattern recognition, red flags, and reporting lines.
  - Privacy and confidentiality.
  - Changes in laws and best practices.

12) Third Parties and Vendors
- Conduct due diligence on KYC/AML vendors.
- Ensure contracts include data protection, uptime, and audit rights.
- Review vendor performance regularly.

13) Exceptions and Escalations
- Temporary exceptions require documented approval by Compliance Officer and time-bound controls.
- Clear escalation path to founder/board for sensitive cases.

14) Reviews and Audits
- Annual program review.
- Independent audits or external assessments as resources allow.

15) Changes and Versioning
- Update this policy when laws or risk profiles change.
- Log changes and notify relevant teams.
