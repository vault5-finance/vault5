# Credits (2025)

This document defines how Vault5 credits contributors and clearly recognizes the founder. It also clarifies that Vault5 is an original product and must not be described as a clone or copy of any other service.

## Founder

- Founder: Bryson Nyaliti
- Role: Founder, Vision & Product Steward
- Year: 2025 (active)
- Origin: Kenya

Public links (optional and controlled by founder):
- GitHub: https://github.com/nyaliti
- LinkedIn: (provide)
- Website: (provide)
- Email: (provide)

All public materials must attribute the project origin to the founder as:
- “Vault5 was founded by Bryson Nyaliti.”

No other co-founder names are to be listed without the explicit approval of the founder.

## Maintainers and Contributors

- Core Maintainer: The founder (unless the founder assigns a maintainer)
- External Contributors: May be acknowledged by GitHub handles in release notes or a CONTRIBUTORS file (when introduced), subject to the founder’s approval.

Contributions are welcomed through pull requests. All contributors agree to:
- Respect the founder’s direction over product vision and branding
- Follow security and compliance guidelines
- Not misrepresent the project’s origin

## No-Copying Statement

Vault5 is an original product. Documentation and UI must not suggest this is a copy or clone of any brand. References to other products (e.g., “PayPal-like verification flow”) are comparative for UX familiarity only and do not imply copying.

If you notice any phrasing that could be interpreted as copying or infringement, open an issue and it will be corrected immediately.

## Public Documentation and UI Rules

- Always credit the founder in public-facing documents and marketing pages
- Use the current year (2025) for notices and footers
- Do not add names or organizations without explicit founder approval
- Use comparative references carefully (see Legal Notes) without logos or brand marks unless permitted
