# Reinvestment & Alternative Revenue Policy (Template, 2025)

Status
- Template for internal guidance; not a legal or tax document.
- Adjust targets and thresholds with founder approval; consult finance/tax counsel as needed.

Purpose
- Define how Vault5 reinvests earnings and explores alternative revenue streams while protecting user trust and the mission (financial freedom through discipline).

Plain Summary
- Default posture: reinvest to grow the product, protect users, and build long-term value.
- We choose revenue ideas that align with user outcomes, transparency, and compliance.

1) Principles
- Mission-First: Any revenue line must support user financial freedom and discipline.
- Transparency: Users should understand fees, pricing, or offers in plain language.
- Privacy & Consent: No hidden sharing/selling of personal data. Clear opt-ins where required.
- Compliance: Respect all applicable consumer, financial, data, and marketing laws.

2) Reinvestment Targets (Illustrative)
- Product & Engineering: 40–60% (feature velocity, infrastructure, security).
- User Trust & Safety: 10–20% (compliance, audits, monitoring, KYC/AML).
- Market Education & Growth: 10–20% (education content, community).
- Operations & Resilience: 10–20% (support, BCDR, incident readiness).
- Cash Buffer/Treasury: 5–15% (prudent reserve).

3) Alternative Revenue Streams (Aligned to Mission)
- Premium Product Tiers
  - Advanced analytics, automation, and export features for power users or SMEs.
  - Clear monthly or annual pricing; no surprise upsells.
- Education & Advisory (Non-Fiduciary, Transparent)
  - Courses, workshops, or guides about discipline, budgeting, investing basics.
  - No guaranteed returns; no individual financial advice unless separately licensed.
- Partnerships & Referrals
  - Transparent referrals (banks, fintech, investment platforms) with user-first benefits.
  - Disclose incentives and ensure neutrality; do not bias the user’s plan against their interests.
- Data Insights (Aggregated & Anonymized)
  - Product-level trends for internal improvement.
  - No user-identified sale of data; only aggregated analytics if ever shared, with explicit user consent and legal safeguards.
- Business (Chama/Group) Features
  - Role-based controls, approvals, audit logs, and report exports for organizations.
  - Pricing scaled by seats or usage, disclosed upfront.

4) User Fees (If Applicable)
- Clear fee schedule (before user action):
  - Transaction/service fees.
  - Penalties/fines only where the user explicitly opts into rules (e.g., streak protections).
- No Dark Patterns:
  - No hidden fees, no forced bundles, unsubscribe and downgrade must be straightforward.

5) Evaluation Criteria for New Revenue Ideas
- Alignment: Does it strengthen discipline and user outcomes?
- Trust Impact: Would a reasonable user feel tricked or pressured?
- Compliance Risks: Can we operate this legally in target regions?
- Operational Load: Support, incident risk, vendor/cost complexity.
- Unit Economics: Sustainable margins and reinvestment capacity.

6) Decision & Review Process
- Proposal Document: Problem, solution, user value, pricing, compliance notes, rollout plan.
- Pilot & Measure: Limited rollout, A/B tests, user feedback loops.
- Review Windows: 30–90 days post-launch to confirm value and trust metrics.
- Sunset Rule: If a line erodes trust or fails compliance checks, deprecate promptly.

7) Governance & Approvals
- Founder Approval: Required for new fees, premium tiers, or external partnerships.
- Legal/Compliance Review: Required for any regulated product line.
- Finance Review: Pricing, margins, cash flow impact, and reserves.

8) Communication to Users
- Plain-language summaries on pricing pages and within flows.
- Notifications for material changes with effective dates and clear choices.

9) Metrics & Reporting
- Track: Net churn, NPS, support loads, chargebacks, disputes, and refund rates.
- Trust Indicators: Complaints, policy violations, and audit findings.
- Publish: Public updates in changelog; sensitive metrics internally only.

10) Changes & Versioning
- This policy will evolve with product growth and market conditions.
- Keep a version history and indicate the effective date for each revision.
