# Ownership & Equity Framework (Template, 2025)

Status
- Template for internal guidance; requires counsel review before binding use.
- Applies to Vault5 as founded by Bryson Nyaliti; adjust numbers and terms before any grants.

Purpose
- Explain who owns what, how ownership can change, and how we evaluate and grant equity fairly.
- Provide a clear, repeatable process when someone asks for a “piece of ownership”.

Plain Summary
- Founder retains majority control at early stage.
- Equity is earned through value creation, time, and risk — not just ideas.
- We prefer written offers, vesting schedules, and clear performance goals.

1) Founding Ownership
- Founder: Majority ownership to steer vision and protect long-term mission (financial freedom through discipline).
- Early allocation reserve: A small pool may be reserved for early core contributors, advisors, and key hires.

2) Equity Instruments We May Use
- Restricted Stock: Actual shares, often used very early.
- Options (ESOP): Rights to buy shares at a set price; vest over time.
- Advisor Grants: Small, time-limited equity for advisors with defined deliverables.
- SAFEs/Convertible Notes (for investors): Cash in exchange for future equity on conversion terms.

3) Vesting & Cliffs (Standard)
- 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff (industry standard).
- Alternative vesting may apply to advisors or short fixed-term projects (e.g., 1-2 years, milestone-based).
- Unvested equity is forfeited if the contributor leaves before vesting.

4) How Someone Can Request Ownership
- Written Proposal: Who you are, what value you bring, time commitment, and specific outcomes.
- Value Evidence: Past impact, portfolio, referrals, or pilot contribution.
- Fit & Risk: Alignment with Vault5 principles; ability to operate under confidentiality and policies.
- Review Window: We aim to respond within 14–30 days for proposals.

5) How We Evaluate Equity Offers
- Stage & Risk: Earlier commitments may justify higher equity for greater risk.
- Time & Role: Amount of time, seniority, and responsibility.
- Scarcity of Skill: Hard-to-find capabilities may warrant higher rates.
- Performance Triggers: Equity tied to milestones or vesting ensures actual value delivery.

6) Ranges (Illustrative Only; not binding)
- Advisor (non-exec): 0.1%–1.0%, vesting 1–2 years, with clear scope and renewal checkpoints.
- Early employee key role: 0.5%–2.5% depending on seniority and risk.
- Contractors: Prefer cash. Small equity only where strategic and approved by the founder.
- Investors: Negotiated via SAFE/convertible note; discount and cap consistent with market norms.

7) Process for Granting Equity
- Intent: Non-binding term sheet approved by founder.
- Legal Docs: Use counsel-backed templates (option agreements, stock agreements, grants).
- Board/Advisor Check: Where applicable as we formalize governance.
- Signatures & Record: Signed copies stored securely; cap table updated.

8) Cap Table Maintenance
- One source of truth maintained by the founder or a designated officer.
- Updates after every grant, exercise, buyback, or transfer.
- Confidential; shared only with authorized parties.

9) Clawbacks & Performance Protections
- For cause termination: Unvested equity is forfeited; vested may be subject to company rights under law.
- Milestone-Based Grants: If milestones are not met, unvested tranches do not accrue.

10) Liquidity and Buybacks
- No guarantee of liquidity before an exit event.
- Company may reserve rights to repurchase shares under defined conditions (to be specified by counsel).

11) Confidentiality & IP
- Contributors must sign NDA and IP assignment clauses as part of offer/engagement documents.
- Work created within scope belongs to the company unless explicitly stated otherwise.

12) Conflicts and Ethics
- Disclose any conflict of interest before signing.
- No self-dealing. All business with contributors must be arms-length and approved.

13) Amendments
- Founder may amend to reflect company growth, regulation, and counsel guidance.
- Changes not retroactive to signed agreements unless agreed by both parties.
