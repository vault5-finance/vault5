# Vault5 Security Policy (2025)

Purpose
- Explain our approach to protecting users, data, and the platform in clear language.
- Guide internal teams on principles and minimum standards.

Plain Summary
- We protect your data using layered controls: identity checks, permissions, encryption, monitoring, and audits.
- We collect only what we need and keep it only as long as necessary.
- We always prefer clarity, consent, and user control.

Security Principles
- Least Privilege: Give every person and system only the access they need.
- Defense in Depth: Multiple layers of protection so one failure does not expose everything.
- Fail Safe: Prefer blocking risky actions rather than allowing uncertain ones.
- Privacy by Design: Minimize data, anonymize where possible, obtain clear consent, and offer easy opt-outs.
- Transparency: We communicate issues and fixes openly and promptly.

User Account Security
- Strong authentication: Password rules, optional 2FA (and device trust), rate limiting.
- Session management: Secure tokens, expiry, and revocation.
- Recovery: Email or phone-based reset flows, with safety checks.
- Suspicious activity: Monitor and notify users of unusual events.

Application Security
- Input validation and sanitization across all endpoints.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with clear admin scopes.
- Secure defaults: CORS whitelisting, CSRF protections (where applicable), secure headers.
- API versioning and audit logs for sensitive actions.

Data Protection
- Encryption in transit (TLS) and at rest where supported by providers.
- Key management: Secrets stored in environment managers or secret stores, rotated when needed.
- Data minimization: Store only what is needed for features and operations.
- Backups: Regular backups with tested restore procedures for critical data sets.

Vulnerability Management
- Static and dynamic scans in CI where possible.
- Dependency monitoring and patching.
- Coordinated disclosure: If you discover a security issue, contact us and we will respond in good faith.
- Incident response processes (see Incident Response Plan) to investigate, contain, and fix.

Operational Security
- Environment separation for development, staging, production.
- Access reviews for admin tools and infrastructure.
- Change management and runbooks for deployments.
- Logging and monitoring: Sensitive operations are recorded. Alerts for anomalies.

Third-Party Services
- Due diligence on vendors handling sensitive data.
- Contracts and Data Processing Addenda (DPAs) as required.
- Minimal scopes on API keys and OAuth tokens.

Compliance
- We will align with applicable laws where we operate (financial, data protection).
- We will publish region-specific compliance notes as we expand (see Document Register).
- PCI DSS scope and notes are maintained (see PCI_DSS_Compliance.md) if payment card data is involved.

User Responsibilities
- Use strong passwords and keep devices secure.
- Be honest in records and do not share accounts.
- Report suspicious activity promptly.

How to Report a Security Issue
- Please contact the founder using the official channel when published.
- Provide steps to reproduce and any evidence you can safely share.
- We will acknowledge, investigate, and work with you to resolve.
